# Vocab
Simple application to help you learn vocabulary.


## Adding words

You can set the words by modifying the json file : Vocab/Model/wordPairs.json . Words are organized by categories, then words and finally languages.

## What update will there be

Right now categories are useless as the user can't chose which category he want to work with. In a future update support for the choose of category will be added.
